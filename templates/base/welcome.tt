        <h2>Welcome to our community project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is a general purpose search engine like Google or Bing. If you want to know more about DuckDuckGo, checkout our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/about.html">About page</a>.</p>
        <p>Our search engine is very very user driven and we like to integrate and get in dialog with our community on all possible levels. We react fast on chat, email or forum. We want to finalize this touch with opening a community platform for all users, which is not only used by our users, but also developed by the community. Everybody can contribute, the community decides where we go.</p>
        <p>One thing the community always requested was options for helping us, spread the word about DuckDuckGo and helping us to extend the options DuckDuckGo offers. We have a bunch of open source projects on our <a href="http://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform">Github organization page</a>, where you can give pull request or can get added as contributor. This is the first reason for this platform, we want the community to help us translate DuckDuckGo into all possible (and impossible ;) ) languages.</p>
        <h2>Translate DuckDuckGo!</h2>
        <p>If you want to help to translate, you must <a href="<@ u('my','register') @>">register</a> or <a href="<@ u('my','login') @>">login</a> with your existing XMPP dukgo.com account to this platform, and then add the languages you can speak. Then you can go through the sets of so called "tokens", small text snippets, which we need to translate. We explain this procedure more clear after you registered or logged in.</p>
