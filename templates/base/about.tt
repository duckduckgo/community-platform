<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit?

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot.

Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>
